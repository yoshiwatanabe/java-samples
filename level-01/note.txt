Summary

Demonstrates what it means to have classes in an anonymous package.
Observe that java files do *not* have "package" declaration.

Steps

Compile Util.java:
javac Util.java
=> Creates Util.class

Compile MyApp.java: 
javac MyApp.java
=> Creates MyApp.class

Run MyApp.class:
java MyApp

Remarks
- We have two java class definitions with no package declaration. This means two classes are in the same "root" (anonymous) package

- You do "javac MyApp.java" and the compiler revolves the symbol by trying to locate Util.class in the root (current) directory (because a current directory is considered an implicit CLASSPATH)
