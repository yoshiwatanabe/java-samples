Summary:
Demonstrates how to create a .jar file. Unlike .NET, classes in Java can be deployed as independent class files (weired, hu?). It can also be packaged into a JAR file, which is nothing but a ZIP file. JAR file is somewhat similar to .NET assembly file, but has some different nuances (which I am trying to get used to)

Steps

Compile Util.java
javac Util.java
=> creates Util.class

Move Util.class to an appropriate directory location
mv Util.class testlib
=> Move the class file under testlib/ directory. This matches the package name

Create a JAR file
jar cf testlib.jar testlib/*.class

Remarks:

You can alsways check the content of JAR file (remember, its just a ZIPed file)
jar tf testlib.jar
