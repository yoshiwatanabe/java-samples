java-samples
============

This is a series of very simple java samples, intended for programmers experienced in other platform/languages, specifically .NET/C# (as I have been one)

It starts from a simple java application that involves two classes: an utility class and a client class that uses the utility class. The samples will demonstrate how to package them, starting from very simple way to more advanced ways.

Unlike most HelloWorld style samples out there, we start off with client/library codes. This is because all production-quality applications break classes info separate modules.
