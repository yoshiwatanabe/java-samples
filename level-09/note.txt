Summary

Demonstrate creating a very simple web application in WAR file, that uses a class in a JAR file

Steps

Create a WAR file
jar cvf mywebapp.war *.jsp WEB-INF
=> creates mywebapp.war file


Copy to a web server (JBoss in this case)
cp mywebapp.war $JBOSS_HOME/standalone/deployments
=> JBoss loads the war file

Check to see our JSP file will return a HTTP response
http://localhost:8080/mywebapp/hi.jsp
=> A test returned from a class stored in a JAR file is returned
